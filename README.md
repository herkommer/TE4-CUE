### User/Player Guide

You can move your character left with left arrow key, right with right arrow key, and jump with up arrow key.
When you collect all the stars the first time it will release a bouncing bomb. 
The bomb will just randomly bounce around the level and if you collide with it, Game Over.
All of the stars will respawn so you can collect them again, and if you do, it will release another bomb.
The more stars you collect, the higher score you get.
